# MarkdownXML

This program generates an XML representation of a Markdown document. This is useful for debugging a Markdown document and for also determining how the [Blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) decides how to parse the document into its AST.

It uses version 2 of the `blackfriday` library.

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/jsternberg/markdownxml/cmd/markdownxml
